        <p>
        A second option is consumer credit counseling.
        There is any number of consumer credit counseling agencies available on the Internet or you may be able to find one locally.
        The best of these are nonprofits.
        When you contact one of these agencies either via a website or in person you will have a counselor that will spend from 45 minutes to an hour with you discussing your finances.
        The best of these agencies charge nothing for that service. </p>

      <p>Depending on how serious are your financial woes your counselor may recommend a debt management plan (DMP).
        The way this would work in brief is your counselor will determine how much you can pay and then negotiate with the creditors on your behalf.
        The negotiation can be for longer terms or lower monthly amounts determined by what payments you could afford to make.
        In some cases your counselor may attempt to negotiate a reduction in your interest rates.
        If all or most all your creditors agree to your debt management plan you would stop paying them.
        Instead, you would send one payment a month to the credit-counseling agency and it will distribute the money to your creditors per your DMP.
        The biggest downside to one of these plans is that they typically take five years to complete.
        You would most li kely be required to give up all the credit cards that are in your plan and would be strongly urged to not take on any new credit until youâ€™ve completed your plan.
        These are the biggest reasons why nearly half of those debtors who sign up for DMP never successfully complete it. </p>

      <p>The benefit of going for this type of debt relief option is that your monthly payment will most likely be much lower than the sum of the payments you are currently making.
        You may also have any penalty charges waived as well as any fees.
        Most of all, you will no longer be harassed by your creditors as they will be handling everything through the debt management agency.</p>
