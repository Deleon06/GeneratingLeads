      <p>If you are generally committed to the idea of getting rid of your credit card debts their are two methods available.
        One is called snowballing your debts and the other is called debt stacking.</p>

      <p>The financial expert Dave Ramsey invented the snowball method.
        The way it works is that you order your credit card debts from the one with the lowest balance down to the one with the highest.
        You then focus all of your efforts on paying off that card with the lowest balance, which will go fairly quickly.
        Of course, you will want to continue making at least the minimum payments on the other cards.
        When you get that first card paid off you’ll now have extra money available to begin paying off the card with the second lowest balance and so on. Dave calls this the snowball method because as you pay off each debt you gain energy and momentum to pay off the next – just like a snowball rolling downhill picks up momentum.
        Here is an example of how this method works. Let’s suppose you have the following debts </p>

<li>$10,000 student loan ($96 payment)</li>
<li>$500 medical bill ($50 payment)</li>
<li>$7,000 car loan ($135 payment)</li>
<li>$2,500 credit card debt ($63 payment)</li>
      <p>If you were able to find an extra $500 a month like maybe by taking on a second job and use the money to pay off that $550 medical bill it would be gone in a month.
        You would now have $550 available to use to pay down the credit card debt.
        You’ll actually be able to pay $613 on it (the $550 you freed up plus your $63 minimum payment.
        This means you’ll be able to say goodbye to that credit card debt in about four months. </p>

      <p>Next comes the automobile debt.
        You’ll now have $748 a month to pay on it.
        This means in 10 months that auto loan will fade off into the sunset.
        What’s left is the student loan debt.
        But now you have a total of $844 a month to put against it.
        This means in about a year it will be gone.
        Add it up and you’ll see that thanks to the hard work you put into this you will have paid off $20,000 in debt in just 27 months. </p>
