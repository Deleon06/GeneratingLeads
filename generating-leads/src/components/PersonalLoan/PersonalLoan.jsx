        Debt consolidation Loans is an increasingly common strategy that consumers are using to address high levels of credit card and other debt.
        Typically, consumers obtain a debt consolidation loan from a lending institution and use it to consolidate all outstanding debts into one loan.
        When you consolidate debt, you’re left with a single monthly payment, which is often at a lower interest rate.
        The result is that it’s easier to manage your outstanding debt so that you’ll be in a better position to pay it off.</p>
        <p>When consolidating debt with a loan, borrowers have two primary options to consider: secured and unsecured debt consolidation loans.
          A secured loan uses some sort of property as collateral, such as your home.
          The collateral makes it more likely you’ll qualify for the debt consolidation loan and get it at a lower interest rate.
          However, if you become unable to repay the loan, your property could be at risk.
          An unsecured loan doesn’t use any of your property, so you don’t have to worry about losing anything if you’re unable to keep up with monthly payments.
          However, unsecured debt consolidation loans usually require a high credit score to qualify, something that people struggling with high levels of debt usually don’t have. </p>
