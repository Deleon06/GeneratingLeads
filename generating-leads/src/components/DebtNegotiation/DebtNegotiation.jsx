        <h1>Debt Negotiation</h1>
      <p>Debt Negotiation at first glance seems scary.
        First you have to make the decision to not pay your creditors.
        Then you have to be confortable with your credit cards closing.
        and lastly you have to be confortable with your credit score going down.
        With all that negative effect, why even consider Debt Negotiation?</p>
      
      <p>First of all, Debt Negotiation is not right for everybody, just like no financial product is right for anybody.
        You have to either access your situation first, or have a professional assess your situation.
        What is my take home, what are my monthly expenses, and what is my credit score should be your first three questions.
