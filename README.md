## Change Log


## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths: Javascript functionality

### Weaknesses: CSS styling

### Opportunities: strengthen my styling capabilities by using javascript, apply new styles that i never used before to give the website more of an appeal. 

### Threats: time constraint, project is looking more of an entire website than just an application.  If I don't focus on MVP first, it could easily not get done in time.
